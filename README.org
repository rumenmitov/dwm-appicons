* About
Adds support for app icons which can be used instead of the tag indicator and tag name. This is configurable through an extra option in =rules=.

Icons should work out of the box. Emojis require a special font like [[https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Color+Emoji][Noto Color Emoji]].

When one or more app icons are present in a tag, the tag name will be encapsulated with the outer separators (=outer_separator_beg= and =outer_separator_end=). Additionally, the icons of the tag will be separated between themselves by =inner_separator=.

Each tag can have a maximum of =truncate_icons_after= icons. After which the =truncate_symbol= will be displayed.
