#+title: DWM - App Icons Patch
#+author: Rumen Mitov

Adds support for app icons which can be used instead of the tag indicator and tag name. This is configurable through an extra option in the *rules*.

When one or more app icons are present in a tag, the tag name will be encapsulated with the outer separators (=outer_separator_beg= and =outer_separator_end=). Additionally, the icons of the tag will be separated between themselves by =inner_separator=.
